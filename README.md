# Unity3D-Defender
A remake of the classic Defender game

It is recommended to play this in windowed mode, in 1600 x 900 resolution. Works with other resolutions too, but a 16:9 ratio is optimal.

Play the game by downloading the build folder, and run the .exe. Use WASD to control, and spacebar to fire.
